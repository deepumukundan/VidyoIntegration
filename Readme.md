# Vidyo Wrapper Project	
___
A convenience wrapper around the Vidyo libraries. Can be used in projects that need video calling integration.
A sample usage pattern is shown in the VidyoIntegration target app. 

## Building the static library
Build the target VidyoWrapper and this will generate  static library and header file which can be used in applications that need video conferencing built in.
Check the build output folder to get the .h and .a files.

## Disclaimer
The base Vidyo libraries used in the wrapper project could be outdated. You might need to replace them with newer versions.
